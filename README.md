## Project Roadmap / Future Plans
Software Development Plan for `Guess It`

   **Smart Contract Development:**
   - Develop smart contracts to handle prediction submissions, validation, and reward distribution.
   - Define variables to store user predictions, validation status, rewards, and other necessary data.
   - Implement functions for users to submit predictions, validate predictions, and claim rewards.

   **Prediction Submission Feature:**
   - Create a function for users to submit their future-oriented predictions to the smart contract.
   - Include parameters for prediction details such as date, description, and associated reward.

   **Prediction Validation Feature:**
   - Develop a validation mechanism where users can vote on the accuracy of predictions.
   - Implement a function to tally validation votes and determine the outcome of predictions.

   **Reward Distribution Feature:**
   - Design a function to distribute rewards to users based on the outcome of their predictions.
   - Calculate rewards dynamically based on the accuracy and validation of predictions.

   **Front-end Development:**
   - Design and develop the user interface for `Guess It` using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Integrate front-end components with smart contract functions to enable seamless interaction with the blockchain.

   **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of smart contract functions and front-end components to ensure functionality and security.
   - Deploy the smart contracts and front-end application on the Internet Computer Protocol.
   - Monitor and optimize performance post-deployment to provide users with a smooth and reliable experience.
